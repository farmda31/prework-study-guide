## Description

I am creating this project to practice creating a working application and practice coding.  

- I hope to become a developer and I believe by practicing with this project, I'll be able to work towards improving my skills.
- I built this project to practice creating javascript and working through loops.  This practice has improved my knowledge and allowed me a safe place to practice.
- It allowed me a free place to practice my current skills and expand my knowledge.
- I learned that having two monitors is incredibly helpful for practicing.  I should take as long as possible to read all instructions.  And I should make sure to remind myself to not get frustrated, take the time that is needed, and be patient with this process.
